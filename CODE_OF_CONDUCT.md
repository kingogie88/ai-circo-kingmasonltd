# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community
* Being mindful of the ethical implications of AI development and implementation

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Implementing AI systems that knowingly cause harm or discriminate against
  protected groups
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## AI-Specific Guidelines

As this is a responsible AI implementation project, we have additional guidelines:

* Ensure all AI implementations respect privacy and data protection principles
* Be transparent about the capabilities and limitations of AI systems
* Consider and mitigate potential biases in AI models and datasets
* Prioritize the safety and wellbeing of individuals affected by AI systems
* Document and share findings about ethical concerns or unintended consequences
* Promote responsible AI development practices within the community

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement by creating an issue
on GitHub at https://github.com/kingogie88/responsible-ai-implementation/issues
with the label "Code of Conduct". All reports will be kept confidential.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:
