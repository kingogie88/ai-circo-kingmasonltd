# Theoretical Background

This document provides the theoretical foundation for the responsible AI implementation, covering key concepts in AI ethics, fairness, privacy, and safety.

## 1. Bias and Fairness

### Types of Bias

#### 1.1 Statistical Bias
Statistical bias occurs when the model's predictions systematically deviate from the true values in the population. Common types include:

- **Selection Bias**: When the training data is not representative of the target population
- **Sampling Bias**: When certain groups are over/under-represented in the data
- **Measurement Bias**: When the data collection process itself introduces systematic errors

#### 1.2 Social Bias
Social bias reflects existing societal prejudices and can manifest in various ways:

- **Historical Bias**: When historical inequities are reflected in the data
- **Representation Bias**: When certain groups are stereotyped or misrepresented
- **Aggregation Bias**: When models fail to account for population subgroups

### Fairness Metrics

#### 2.1 Group Fairness
Group fairness measures aim to ensure equal treatment across different demographic groups:

- **Demographic Parity**: P(Ŷ=1|A=a) = P(Ŷ=1|A=b)
  - Ensures equal positive prediction rates across groups
  - Limitation: May sacrifice individual fairness

- **Equal Opportunity**: P(Ŷ=1|Y=1,A=a) = P(Ŷ=1|Y=1,A=b)
  - Ensures equal true positive rates across groups
  - Better preserves utility when ground truth is available

- **Equalized Odds**: P(Ŷ=1|Y=y,A=a) = P(Ŷ=1|Y=y,A=b) for y ∈ {0,1}
  - Ensures equal true positive and false positive rates
  - Strongest notion of group fairness

#### 2.2 Individual Fairness
Individual fairness focuses on similar treatment for similar individuals:

- **Lipschitz Condition**: d₁(f(x₁), f(x₂)) ≤ L·d₂(x₁, x₂)
  - Where d₁ and d₂ are appropriate distance metrics
  - L is the Lipschitz constant

## 2. Model Explainability

### Local Explanations

#### 2.1 LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)
- Creates interpretable representations of complex models
- Generates local linear approximations
- Key equation: argmin ℒ(f, g, πₓ) + Ω(g)

#### 2.2 SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
- Based on cooperative game theory
- Shapley values: φᵢ = Σ(|S|!(|F|-|S|-1)!/|F|!)(f(S∪{i}) - f(S))
- Properties:
  - Local accuracy
  - Missingness
  - Consistency

### Global Explanations

#### 2.3 Feature Importance
- Aggregate impact of features on model predictions
- Methods:
  - Permutation importance
  - SHAP value aggregation
  - Integrated gradients

## 3. Privacy Protection

### Differential Privacy

#### 3.1 Mathematical Definition
ε-Differential Privacy: P(M(D₁) ∈ S) ≤ exp(ε)·P(M(D₂) ∈ S)

Where:
- D₁, D₂ are adjacent datasets
- M is the privacy mechanism
- ε is the privacy budget
- S is any subset of possible outputs

#### 3.2 Privacy Mechanisms

##### Laplace Mechanism
- Adds Laplace noise calibrated to sensitivity
- f'(x) = f(x) + Lap(Δf/ε)
- Δf is the sensitivity of function f

##### Gaussian Mechanism
- Adds Gaussian noise for (ε,δ)-differential privacy
- f'(x) = f(x) + N(0, σ²)
- σ ≥ √(2ln(1.25/δ))·Δf/ε

## 4. Safety Monitoring

### Concept Drift Detection

#### 4.1 Statistical Tests
- Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
- Wasserstein distance
- Maximum Mean Discrepancy

#### 4.2 Performance Monitoring
- Statistical Process Control (SPC)
- CUSUM charts
- EWMA monitoring

### Safety Constraints

#### 4.3 Constraint Types
- Hard constraints (must never be violated)
- Soft constraints (should be minimized)
- Probabilistic constraints

#### 4.4 Enforcement Methods
- Pre-deployment validation
- Runtime monitoring
- Graceful degradation

## 5. Governance Framework

### Risk Assessment

#### 5.1 Impact Levels
- Low: Minimal potential for harm
- Medium: Moderate potential for harm
- High: Significant potential for harm
- Critical: Severe potential for harm

#### 5.2 Control Measures
- Technical controls
- Procedural controls
